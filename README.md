# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game

## 📌 Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player strategy game played on a **3×3 grid**.
Players take turns marking a cell with **X** or **O**.
The objective is to be the **first player to align three marks** horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This project implements a **simple, interactive, and beginner-friendly** Tic Tac Toe game using basic programming concepts.
